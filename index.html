    <p>By continuing to use this website, you acknowledge and agree to the below disclaimer:</p>
<p><strong>Disclaimer</strong></p>
<p>This website provides publicly available pricing information for weight-loss services offered by pharmacies. Prices are updated on an ad-hoc basis and may change without notice. Users are strongly encouraged to verify prices directly with pharmacies before making any purchasing decisions. While we strive to include a comprehensive list of pharmacies, some may not be represented.</p>
<p>This website is intended for individuals who have already made an informed decision, in consultation with a healthcare professional, to use a specific weight-loss service. It does not promote, endorse, or encourage the use of any service or medication. Its sole purpose is to facilitate transparent price comparisons.</p>
<p>We make every effort to ensure that listed pharmacies are legitimate and registered with the General Pharmaceutical Council (GPhC) or an equivalent regulatory authority. However, users should independently verify the registration and legitimacy of any pharmacy before making a purchase. This website assumes no responsibility for the accuracy, safety, or legality of the services provided by listed pharmacies.</p>
<p>This website does not advertise, promote, or recommend any specific weight-loss product, service, or pharmacy. All information is provided strictly for price comparison purposes and should not be interpreted as advertising, solicitation, or endorsement.</p>
<p>Certain weight-loss products are available only by prescription and require consultation with a qualified healthcare professional. Users should follow their healthcare provider’s guidance regarding the suitability and appropriateness of any service.</p>
<p>MK Compare remains completely impartial, and our rankings are in no way influenced by affiliate partnerships or referal links. Pharmacies with an affiliate relationship are clearly marked with the word “affiliate” below their logo, and those that contain a referral link are marked with the word "referral". However, this does not affect their ranking or the way we present information. Using an affiliate/referral link or code costs you nothing extra, but I may earn a commission or other incentives, which helps keep the site running. Our goal is to provide transparent and unbiased comparisons to help you make informed decisions.</p>
<p>This website includes links to third-party websites for informational purposes. These external links are provided for your convenience, and we do not endorse or take responsibility for the content, products, or services offered on those sites. We encourage users to review the privacy policies and terms of use of any external website before engaging with it. While we strive to link only to reputable sources, we cannot guarantee the accuracy, legality, or safety of external content. Any transactions or interactions with third-party sites are at your own risk.</p>
